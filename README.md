# Miayam Blog

Hello! It's been 4 years since I built this shitty blog site
with Jekyll in early 2017. Back then, I was a Junior Ruby on Rails Developer at
HarukaEdu and wasn't doing well there. In my last day, I could feel
the dissapointments from both CTO and teammates about my performance
during one and a half years of employment. It was plain to see that
I made a wrong carrer decision. I was very bad at querying database,
but pretty good at querying the DOM, so I decided to pivot and began
my career as Frontend Developer. Despite my bad performance, I made
few good friends at HarukaEdu. I attend some of their weddings even
if I hate mingling with people. I made an exception for them.

4 years has passed, I don't regret my decision.
Now it is time for the new chapter. The new [miayam.io](https://miayam.io).

I leave what remain in this repo "AS IS". I won't archive it. 

Farewell good friend! It's been a bumpy ride but you've done wonders so far!
