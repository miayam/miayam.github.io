I found a [great article](https://markmanson.net/not-giving-a-fuck) that really slaps me on the face.

Whenever I get annoyed by people who don't really matter in my life, I always google a question on how to deal with them.
I am not good with people, so I won't ask them for help if possible.

As far as I believe, human beings are disgusting animal. Yeah, we are the only beings with 3 faces when we've reached adulthood.
I too often look outward and go on insulting people in my mind so as to comfort myself, forgetting that I am also a human being.
That's not good for my mental strength and I should stop.

Let's start from within, right at the core of my being. Who the fuck I am?

When was the last time I saw the sky without buildings blocking my view?

Oh dear universe, how small I am. How insignificant object I am compared to those glorious stars in the sky.

Well... for knowing that shit, to whom my fucks should be given then? Those disgusting animal or the stars?

I don't want to get involved in misunderstanding anymore. Really, misunderstanding is the default mode for human interaction.

So, what is the source of understanding then? I think the answer is mathematics. Mathematics is difficult subject to learn but
I would love to spend my entire adult life on it. I decide to be an actuary if possible. I am 25 now, no time to waste!
