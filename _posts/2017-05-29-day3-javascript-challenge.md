I am doing it so fast in the office. Not quite interesting.

<div class="blog-post-image">
  <img src="/images/lala_again.jpg" alt="Oh God, she is beauitiful">
  <em>Stop smiling because I love you!</em>
</div>

Well, I can only change the image background and comment on code that's really
important to me. Here's the [demo](/demo_day3){:target="_blank"}.

One good thing about CSS variable is when you change the variable
any elements that have reference to it will change as is. The behaviour of CSS
variable has no difference from the rest of CSS features, it cascades. You can
override it if you declare CSS variable on child element. In this challenge,
all CSS variables declared on `:root` (`<html>` tag).

Here's yet another boring JavaScript code.
