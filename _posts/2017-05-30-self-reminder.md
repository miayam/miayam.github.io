Worry not, worry not.

Dear myself, you are going to die sooner or later. You probably won't care about this event or those events when you have it coming.
Death I mean.

Dear myself, you are not compelete asshole. You care about your family and do your best for them.

Dear myself, you brag about everything, you are fucking fuck. Need more improvement!

Dear myself, you are not going to be here or there forever. You have imagined working abroad with different people from different
cultures. Be real, be confident, be strong mentally. Improve your English. Come on!

Dear myself, how about reading more about philosopy, the real deal philosphy.

Dear myself, those videos you watch on and on when you are nothing. Watch them idiot!

Dear myself, do you remember your schizophrenic episodes? You gets better right now!

Annoying people are going to die in one way or another. When they die, life goes on. Your fucks will be meaningless.
Can you believe it? Please dear man, get your fucks together!

Meditate more my dear.

Remember one thing, one thing only. Death is the only destiny we share. Watch more Steve Jobs speech.
