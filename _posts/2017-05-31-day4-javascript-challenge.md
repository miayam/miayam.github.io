I have to do it on and on until I get it. Never underestimate the power of JavaScript's Array!

In this challenge, there's no interesting thing like manipulating the DOM or
whatsoever. It's purely intellectual journey towards JavaScript's Array
mastery. Here's the [demo](/demo_day4){:target="_blank"} and
the [repo](https://github.com/miayam/js30){:target="_blank"}.

Every time you reload the page, please open the console and see the result
of my work. You have to redo the challenge until you really get it. It's really
hard, especially reduce method. My first attempt is awful but the next 10th
attempt is awesome (kidding).
