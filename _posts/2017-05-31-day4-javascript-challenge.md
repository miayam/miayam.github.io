I have to do it on and on until I get it. Never underestimate the power of JavaScript's Array!

<div class="blog-post-image">
  <img src="/images/aoi.jpg" alt="she is cute">
  <em>Oh God, please help me! It's too cute!</em>
</div>

In this challenge, there's no interesting thing like manipulating the DOM or
whatsoever. It's purely intellectual journey towards JavaScript's Array
mastery. Here's the [demo](/demo_day4){:target="_blank"}.

Every time you reload the page, please open the console and see the result
of my work. You have to redo the challenge until you really get it. It's really
hard, especially reduce method. My first attempt is awful but the next 10th
attempt is awesome (kidding).

I am sorry, there must be a cute girl in every post about 30 day JavaScript
challenge so as to cheer me up. Until tomorrow!

I am running out of cute girls! I don't know who is going to be in my next post!
Emi Takei maybe?
