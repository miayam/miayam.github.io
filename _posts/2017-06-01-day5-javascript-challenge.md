I know nothing about CSS flexbox!

I will skip all the CSS thingy in this challenge and focus on the experience I'd love to have.
At first, in Wes Bos JavaScript code, when you click one of the panels, it will make it bigger and the rest will shrink.
If you click the other one while letting the previous one clicked (it's toggle), both panels will shrink but still bigger than
the rest. What I want to have is when I click the other panel, the previous one will shrink, so there's only one bigger
panel in the row. If I keep explaining this to you with words, it would be more complicated.
Just see the damn [demo](/demo_day5){:target="_blank"}. Have a look at the entire challenges, here's the
[repo](https://github.com/miayam/js30){:target="_blank"}

Here's yet another boring JavaScript code with a little bit of explanation.

I hate this challenge.
