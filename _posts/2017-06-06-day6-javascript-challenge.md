programming.

Firstly, I copied the boilerplate and tinkered with the UI for a bit. I intended to make it look more

I had nothing to say about this challenge. Here's the [demo](/demo_day6){:target="_blank"} and
the [repo](https://github.com/miayam/js30){:target="_blank"}. Please, read it while fixing
your eyes on that beauitiful girl above!

I like this challenge.
