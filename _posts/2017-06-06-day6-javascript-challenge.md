I was using fetch method which really shows me the Promise and its early usage for AJAX
programming. Here's one of the most cutest girl in China.

I had nothing to say about this challenge. Here's the [demo](/demo_day6){:target="_blank"} and
the [repo](https://github.com/miayam/js30){:target="_blank"}. Please, read the gist while fixing
your eyes on that beautiful girl above!

Firstly, I copied the boilerplate and tinkered with the UI for a bit. I intended to make it look more
like Reddit with its calming light blue. I ditched all the CSS transition and went on with boring
design which I really love the most.

I like this challenge.
