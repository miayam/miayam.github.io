I was using fetch method which really shows me the Promise and its early usage for AJAX
programming. I had nothing to say about this challenge. Here's the [demo](/demo_day6){:target="_blank"}
and the [repo](https://github.com/miayam/js30){:target="_blank"}.

Firstly, I copied the boilerplate and tinkered with the UI for a bit. I intended to make it look more
like Reddit with its calming light blue. I ditched all the CSS transition and went on with boring
design which I really love the most.

I like this challenge.
