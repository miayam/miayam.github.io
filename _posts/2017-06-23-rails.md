Probably my time as Ruby on Rails Developer is up.

Every carpenter has his/her own favorite tool-set and mine is
JavaScript.

I know nothing about Rails and refuse to go any further. I have a love affair
with JavaScript and its horror environment (DOM and Web API).

I refuse to touch database directly. ORM is fine for now, but please, just give
me the damn end-point and let me consume it.

I refuse to set up tedious configuration. I barely know about infrastructure
whatsoever. I am sorry that I have a love affair with JavaScript and its horror
environment (not Node.jsÂ®).

Okay, I will leave Rails gradually starting from now.

For Ruby, I still love it. I am willing to learn Ruby and Sinatra after I kind
of master JavaScript.
