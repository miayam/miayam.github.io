Words are not words until a real man believe in it!

I've heard some motherfucking German philosophers once said, "Words are just words until idiots take them personal!"
Those motherfucking German philosophers are briliant and I trust them completely.

Let me tell you the words I consume every day. When the world seems to fall apart, the words are
guarding me figuratively.

I believe in these words!

> When you find a path to the top, "Is it too abrupt? Is that possible?"
> None of that matters! You just have to climb!
>
> If you are lacking the talent, then ask for the help of others without shame!
>
> Dirty your own hands even if you have to bear the contempt of the ones you love
> in order to get to the top, in order to quench this thirst that is burning every
> man. Getting to the top! If you can't aim to the top alone, then find someone to
> go with you.
>
>
> What should a man not chosen by God do?
>
> There is an answer that only a man that kept strugling until the end can see.
