It's such a "cooling down" challenge. Nothing more boring than sorting list with built-in JavaScript Array's methods.

I can only say that I know nothing about regular expression. The challenge instruct us to sort those list of bands, but we
have to exclude their article ('a', 'an', 'the') first. For example, "The Corrs" will be displayed first before "Gorillaz".

The challenge could be more challenging if only I know a bit about `regex`. `regex` is expensive skill that
requires years of traning to master.

This is my stupid approach to hurry things up. I don't care about the better solution.
