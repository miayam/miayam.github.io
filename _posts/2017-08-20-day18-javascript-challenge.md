It's kind of boring, but at least it has something to do with the DOM. It's yet another JavaScript's `Array` manipulation.

Imagine yourself a `YouTuber` and you kind of wonder about the total duration of all videos you've uploaded. With a little help from
our friends at Mozilla, you can read the documentation about
[`Array.prototype`'s available methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array){:target="_blank"}
and tinker with it as if you understand how it works. The time format displayed on YouTube are like this `45:05` and
adding up each video's duration with that time format is not that complicated!

Here's the [demo](/demo_day18){:target="_blank"}.

I finish this challenge this way. I refuse to touch ES6 and decide to employ ES5 everywhere for this
lovely 30 day JavaScript challenge. On December 3, 2009, Ecma International® published ES5 specification.
On the same date, ルル オーリア and I made our first eye contact.
