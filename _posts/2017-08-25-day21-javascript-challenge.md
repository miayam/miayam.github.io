I don't have Mac, so doing the actual challenge might be frustrating. However, playing (copy-pasting)
with Google Map API doesn't leave bad taste in my mouth.

The challenge requires us to install simulator that only runs on Mac computer. I refuse to buy expensive
Mac computer to engage in this challenge. The challenge itself is quite simple, it's about employing
geolocation API to manipulate compass-like image, so it will rotate in accord to device's changing position, speed
and heading. I replace the challenge with manipulating Google Map using that same geolocation API.

Here's the [demo](/demo_day21){:target="_blank"} and my stupid code below.
