It's just a distillation from `this` & Object Prototype of YDKJS (You Don't Know JavaScript)
book series. I want to understand how classical object oriented style has been imposed on
JavaScript for decades and how the true mechanism of `[[Prototype]]` chain works in accordance
to alternative design pattern Kyle provides in his book (behaviour delegation or OLOO). Some
eccentric German philosophers said, "You don't really understand something until you are able
to explain it to yourself in a simple manner!"

Let's debunk all misconceptions about OOP in JavaScript in a simple manner!

### 1. No Such Thing Like Class!

{% highlight js %}
  function Human(name) {
    this.name = name
    console.log("You are created by God!");
  }

  var me = new Human("Muhammad D. Ramadhan");
  me.name // Muhammad D. Ramadhan
  me.constructor === Human // true

  // You can't access [[Prototype]] like this, but
  // the statement below is true!
  me.[[Prototype]] === Human.prototype // true
{% endhighlight %}

`Human` is an ordinary function that happens to be paved over by `new` keyword, so
it returns newly created object out of thin air in addition to executing all
statements in its function's body (`this.name` assignment and `console.log`).
We'll be back to this later.

Now, we have to understand what exactly `[[Prototype]]` property is.

You might have heard that every object in JavaScript is linked to other object
via `[[Prototype]]`. That property is not accessible. However, in modern
browser (most latest version of Chrome), you can access that property via
`__proto__`.

{% highlight js %}
  var foo = { name: "Your name" };
  foo.__proto__; // Object.prototype
{% endhighlight %}

You might have wondered how come we can access `toString` property?

{% highlight js %}
  foo.toString() // [object Object]
{% endhighlight %}

We didn't even declare `toString` property, right?

{% highlight js %}
  var foo = {
    name: "Your Name",
    toString: function() {
      // Implementation...
    }
  };
{% endhighlight %}

In reality, `foo` object has link to `Object.prototype` object via `[[Prototype]]` property,
so it looks up and follows the `[[Prototype]]` chain to find `toString`.

Let's see how it's done:

{% highlight js %}
  // We actually access it via [[Prototype]] / __proto__.
  foo.__proto__.toString === Object.prototype.toString // true
  foo.toString === foo.__proto__.toString // true
{% endhighlight %}

Nah, how about that `me` object "constructed by" `Human` function above?

{% highlight js %}
  me.constructor; // Human
{% endhighlight %}

See? It's logical to assume that the `me` object is constructed by `Human`, right?
That `constructor` property refers to `Human` function!

Well, don't be fooled by that! It doesn't mean `me` object is constructed by `Human`.
As the subtitle said, "there's no such thing like class!"

Everytime you declare a function, no matter what it is, you will get access to
its own `prototype` property and the default value of that property is
this object:

{% highlight js %}
  Human.prototype;
  // { constructor: f }
{% endhighlight %}

Interestingly, that `constructor` property point back to the function itself:

{% highlight js %}
  Human.prototype.constructor === Human // true
{% endhighlight %}

Bear it in mind, `new Human("Muhammad D. Ramadhan");` will create new object and make its `[[Prototype]]`
property link to `Human.prototype`, so that new object can access default
`Human.prototype`'s properties (`constructor` in our case) or any properties
you add to it later on. Here's the example:

{% highlight js %}
  function Human(name) {
    this.name = name;
    console.log("You are created by God!");
  }

  // Add new property, so new object created by construction call
  // (`new` keyword in front of ordinary function call) have access
  // to introduceOnceself indirectly via [[Prototype]].
  // No instantiation. No inheritance. It's just linking!
  Human.prototype.introduceOneself = function () {
    console.log(`My name is ${this.name} and I like チージア セリーナ`);
  };

  var me = new Human('Muhammad D. Ramadhan');
  me.introduceOneself();

  // My name is Muhammad D. Ramadhan and I like チージア セリーナ
{% endhighlight %}

Actually, we access `introduceOneself` property this way:

{% highlight js %}
  me.__proto__.introduceOneself();
  me.__proto__ === Human.prototype // true
  me.__proto__.introduceOneself === Human.prototype.introduceOneself; // true
  me.introduceOneself === me.__proto__.introduceOneself; // true
{% endhighlight %}

The same thing goes to that bogus `constructor` property!

{% highlight js %}
  me.__proto__.constructor === Human.prototype.constructor // true
  me.constructor === me.__proto__.constructor // true
{% endhighlight %}

Truth be told, we can override `constructor` or `prototype`!
I don't think I can rely on parent-children relationship
if I can freely change those properties!

{% highlight js %}
  Human.prototype = { constructor: "Ha ha ha, you are bogus!" };
  me = new Human("Muhammad D. Ramadhan");
  me.constructor // Ha ha ha, you are bogus!
{% endhighlight %}


### 2. It Is Really Complicated

Here's how I implement classical object oriented style in JavaScript.

Follow the `[[Prototype]]` chain to look up properties not directly accessible on current object.

Alright then, that's it for today. Next time, we are going to get rid of this complex
mechanism using behaviour delegation (OLOO).
