This is improvement for [day 22 JavaScript challenge](/javascript/2017/08/27/day22-javascript-challenge){:target="_blank"} (copying Stripe feature). It's not so bad.

I'll say that again, it's superfluous for a web page to have this kind of feature. Craig Newmark will look
away and insult us in his mind! Well, if it was for fun, I wouldn't attach too much importance to his
thinking. Here we are completely copying Stripe new web page! Here's the [demo!](/demo_day26){:target="_blank"}

I've got nothing to say, but it's really fun. Here's my solution.

That's it for today.
