Scrolling that fancy carousel by grabbing and moving it back and forth... That sounds boring.

At first, I really wanted to skip ahead and moved on to the next challenge. I was terrified by CSS.
After hearing チージア セリーナ said 'yes' to my invitation, I got up and read that CSS snippet with hustle.
Stupid feeling sometime moves people. And then I found a great resource about CSS 3D transforms!
Kudos to [David DeSandro](https://desandro.com/){:target="_blank"} for his clear explanation!

I am not willing to bother myself repeating what the author says. Let him explain himself.
Here's [his blog](https://desandro.github.io/3dtransforms/){:target="_blank"} and my [demo](/demo_day27){:target="_blank"}.

By the way, I am not concerned about how I finish the challenge,
I am just concerned about チージア セリーナ's cute ponytail...
