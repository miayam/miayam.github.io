This is how I keep my mind occupied. I don't want to be a dweller.

Some German philosopher told me, "It's your fault,
it's always been your fault. It takes a man to own up his own mistakes! Don't
be 'banci', anjing!"

By the way, I lose interest in Frontend Development. I told my
newest co-worker Aswinda, a man of honour who graduated from IPB and UGM that I am done
with this unfullfilling job. I want to quit. I want to quit and that's my fault.

Despite his strong background in machine learning, he ended up being Software Engineer and
has lost interest in Software Development.

Why is it hard to find my Ikigai? Should I struggle more? I don't know.

Well, as for now I am going to start over as fast as possible. Move forward little by little
starting from [this beautiful book](http://www.pythonlearn.com/book.php)
and [Khanacademy](https://www.khanacademy.org). I'll finish my bullshit on MIT OCW, all courses
that's required for bachelor degree in Mathematics.

Okay, let's do it, bitch!
