    <p>Scope is a set of rules that determines where and how
a variable can be looked-up. Always refer <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch1.md">to this</a>.</p>

<p>It seems trivial for newbie like me but there’s actually a lot of things to ponder.
Anyway, how JavaScript engine works then? Let’s pretend to be one.</p>

<p>I am an <strong>ENGINE</strong>. I have <strong>COMPILER</strong> and <strong>SCOPE</strong> to translate human language (ECMAScript).</p>

<p>When I see statement like:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><table style="border-spacing: 0"><tbody><tr><td class="gutter gl" style="text-align: right"><pre class="lineno">1</pre></td><td class="code"><pre>  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w">
</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>

<p>I’ll be using <strong>COMPILER</strong> to do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Turn it into chunks of meaningful word (token) I can understand. <code class="highlighter-rouge">var</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">b</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">=</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">20</code>. (1)</li>
  <li>Those words must be organized in a way I could look them up in my human-to-machine dictionary.
This organized words are called AST (Abstract Syntax Tree). It’s like trying to make a sentence in
accord to machine grammar rules. (2)</li>
  <li>Now list of translated words are understood, I can figure out what human want me to do. (3)</li>
</ul>

<p>Human want me to use up memory for variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">b</code> and stick the value <code class="highlighter-rouge">20</code> into it. To do so, I’d like to
make use of <strong>SCOPE</strong> to accomplish the task. <strong>SCOPE</strong> is a magical room containing collection of variables.</p>

<p>Imagine I am in the building.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Microsecond ago, during compilation, <strong>COMPILER</strong> encountered <code class="highlighter-rouge">var b</code>, that means I have to declare variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">b</code>.
I then check <strong>SCOPE</strong> collection, see if variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">b</code> already exist. If so, proceed to do other task and
ignore the declaration because I know where to find <code class="highlighter-rouge">b</code>. Otherwise, put the new variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">b</code>
into <strong>SCOPE</strong> collection. (4)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During execution, how could I possibly stick the value <code class="highlighter-rouge">20</code> into <code class="highlighter-rouge">b</code>? Well firstly while running, look
up <code class="highlighter-rouge">b</code> in the current <strong>SCOPE</strong>. If there is a variable called <code class="highlighter-rouge">b</code> accesible, assign the value <code class="highlighter-rouge">20</code> to it.
Otherwise, go to the next room (<strong>SCOPE</strong>) upstairs that might have knowledge of it, so on until I reach
the limit, the top level floor (global <strong>SCOPE</strong>). If nowhere to find <code class="highlighter-rouge">b</code>, I yell at human “ERROR!!!” (5)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>
What <strong>COMPILER</strong> has done for <strong>ENGINE</strong> are lexing (1), parsing (2) and code generation (3).
Point (4) and (5) explain how <strong>COMPILER</strong> interact with <strong>SCOPE</strong> during compilation and how <strong>ENGINE</strong>
execute the generated code from code generation.</p>
