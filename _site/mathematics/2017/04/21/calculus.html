<p>If we were to measure the derivative of <script type="math/tex">f(x)</script> which is the slope at certain point where tangent line touch the graph,
we have to draw another line that seems to touch the point very close to it.</p>

<p>Lets pay our attention to the graph above. We see that tangent line (the red one)
touch the graph and secant line (the dashed blue one) is adjusted, so we can
approximately measure the derivative of <script type="math/tex">f(x)</script>.</p>

<p>If <script type="math/tex">h \to 0</script> (the gap <script type="math/tex">h</script> tends to 0), both lines will be merged as if they are nothing but one single straight line. This is the main idea of
how we measure derivative using geometrical approach. Now, we can only see the gap between tangent and secant line using
highly modern microscope.</p>

<p>In high school, we’ve encountered the formula to measure the slope <script type="math/tex">m = \Delta f / \Delta x</script>. <script type="math/tex">m</script> means slope, <script type="math/tex">\Delta f</script> means the change in <script type="math/tex">y</script> axes,
<script type="math/tex">\Delta x</script> means the change in <script type="math/tex">x</script> axes.</p>

<p>Take that <script type="math/tex">P</script> is the red line and <script type="math/tex">Q</script> is the dashed blue line, we will have 2 point <script type="math/tex">P(x, f(x))</script> and <script type="math/tex">Q(x+h, f(x+h))</script>.</p>

<p>Because derivative of <script type="math/tex">f(x)</script> is a mere slope, we can get this formula right off the bat:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{df}{dx} = \lim_{ h \to 0 } \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}</script>
