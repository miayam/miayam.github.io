About Me
========

I am a boring person interested in building user-facing application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I blog
about anything that interest me and most of my writings here are going to be dedicated to JavaScript and
the web in general.

For good reason, JavaScript is a wierd programming language and might takes a lot of time to tame it. I have spent my
precious time, money, and energy on it, therefore I love it!

Most of the time, I wield JavaScript to tinker with the DOM and Web API to create certain behaviour that makes me smile
with pride. I am very grateful for picking up the right hobby.

Potential friends should know each other's shortcomings. I suck at SQL, NoSQL, any kind of
fullstack frameworks (Django, Laravel, Ruby on Rails, etc), any kind of ORM libraries, or any fancy things most developers
love to talk about (shiny new technologies).

For more details, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miayam/), [GitHub](https://github.com/miayam), [CodePen](https://codepen.io/miayam/),
and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/miiayam). If you got any questions about anything, fell free to [send me email](mailto:muhammaddeni90@gmail.com).
I hope you will find this blog interesting.
